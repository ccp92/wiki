## requirements.txt
Similarly to a package file in a javascript project or a gemfile in a ruby project, python has a requirements.txt file which stores the dependencies of a project.
However, an issue with using the `requirements.txt` file is that it only notes the top level dependencies, not the dependencies of the dependencies.
Because of this, running `pip install -r requirements.txt` may result in different sets of packages being installed.

Typically the solution to this is to run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` which resolves the issues with higher defree dependencies.
However, this introduces a new issue; if you need to delete a dependencies, there is no easy way to know that you have removed all of the dependencies related to that package.

## pip-compile
pip-compile is a tool that is available as part of pip-tools.
Instead of writing a `requirements.txt` file, a `requirements.in` file is written instead, containing the direct dependencies of the project.
When `pip-compile` is run, it generates a `requirements.txt` file from the `requirements.in` file, which contains all of the dependencies (including those at higher degrees of seperation) and locks the versions.
Now, when removing a top level dependency from your `requirements.in` file, re-running `pip-compile` will remove the dependency and all of the higher degree dependencies from the `requirements.txt` for you.
